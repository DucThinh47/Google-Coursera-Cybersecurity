# introduction-to-the-eight-cissp-security-domains-part-1-&-2

CISSP xác định tổng cộng 8 domain: 

1. Security and Risk Management: security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and the law

2. Asset Security: secures digital and physical assets; storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

3. Security Architecture and Engineering: optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. 

4. Communications and Network Security: manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications

5. Identify and Access Management: keep datas secure, by ensuring users follow established policies, manage physical and logical assets

6. Security Assessment and Testing: conducting security control setting, collecting and analyzing data, conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities

7. Security Operations: conducting investigations and implemeting preventative measures

8. Software Development Security: secure coding practices, create secure applications and services

**Attack types**

1. **Password attack**

    A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attack: 

    - Brute force

    - Rainbow table

    Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

2. **Social engineering attack**

    Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attack: 

    - Phishing

    - Smishing

    - Vishing

    - Spear phishing

    - Whaling

    - Social media phishing

    - Business Email Compromise (BEC)

    - Watering hole attack

    - USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting

    - Physical social engineering 

    Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

3. **Physical attack**

    A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms: 

    - Malicious USB cable

    - Malicious flash drive

    - Card cloning and skimming

    Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain. 

5. **Adversarial artificial intelligence**

    Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently.

    Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

6. **Supply-chain attack**

    A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed

    These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them.

    Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

7. **Cryptographic attack**

    A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms:

    - Birthday

    - Collision

    - Downgrade

    Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

**Threat actor types**

1. **Advanced persistent threats**

    Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization.

2. **Insider threats**

    Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.

3. **Hacktivists**

    Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda.
